# VacationPlanner
backend

Project Title: Vacation Planner

The backend of this project was built using inteliJ ultimate edition. I used the project we did in class as a major reference in order to complete my backend

To run the project you simply need to open the project on an ide such as InteliJ and run the project

In the beginning i had made a few capitalization mistakes that i did not catch which made it so that my backend was showing red and certain things were greyed out when they were not supposed to be. Eventually i caught the mistakes after comparing the code to the backend we made in class and i was able to resovle my problem and build a fully functional backend.
In the future i would like to add more entities and just expand on the backend to make it feel more complete. I could have added more info per entity to be more precise for the users among other things.

Design
The desing and classes are heavily influenced by the backend we made in class. The entities have requests that are menat to allow a user to add the entiy to website, update it and delete it.

The destination entity is on top and it links to the task entity as a one to many.
The destination entity also links to the flight entity as a one to one.
